# NASA Web App
Creating a NASA App that grabs the Astronomy Picture of the Day on the Home Page. On the Events page I used the The Earth Observatory Natural Event Tracker (EONET) to detect natural events happening around the world.

This app was created for the Hack the Break 2022 Event. 

Live running app on Heroku:
https://ms-nasa-app.herokuapp.com/

Frontend: React, Tailwindcss, Axios (API Connection), flex, grid, .map for looping through objects, HTML, CSS
Backend: Express
API: EONET (Events Page), and Astronomy Picture of the Day (Home page)
Deployed: Heroku
